# Technical Advice

This section is to give you the recommended techniques. For those who want to get `certified datapack‚úîÔ∏è` & `stamp of qualityüíï` and little funny final comment from *Datapack Reviewer EstEarth202üëç* with `LOL` or `LMAO` or maybe a special comment.

This has been compiled from some of the common issues from my experiences with datapack reviews.

## P.S.

I'm not saying this technique is the best, but for me, I understand how good it is.

That being said, **not force**, that's one of the respect I have to offer

If you can understand it, it means that I have been successful in spreading my experience.

I once thought I would stop making such suggestions. But Professor Boomber encouraged me.

**Boomber:** Personally, I think you should keep giving your advice. There will be someone like this sometime but most of the time your advice will be very beneficial to the datapacker. You shouldn't let one negative comment affect you.

So I keep doing it. And hope you understand what I have given you.
